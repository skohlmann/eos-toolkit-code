      <question>
        eos commons under the AGPL but I use a more business like license?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>eos is free software that means: it is open-source and free.
          Licenses like <a href='http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt'>Apache 2.0</a>
          are not free for software, also free for business. But thats not a
          problem. Think about Linux. It comes under the
          <a href='http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt'>GNU General Public License</a>
          and its a billion dollar market. So think about your business.</p>
